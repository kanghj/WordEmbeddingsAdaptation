convert_one_million_to_csv.py is used for converting the one-million-sense-tagged data into csv format. This is provided by the NUS NLP group: http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~nlp/corpora.html, by Kaveh Taghipour.

drop_commas.py can then be used to convert the csv into a space delimited file instead, if that is preferred.
